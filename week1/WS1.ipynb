    "    At the top of the page, there is a menu bar that includes a series of drop-down menus, e.g., File, Edit, View, etc.. Next is the tool bar, which allows you to do various operations such as saving the notebook, manipulating cells, executing cells, etc. Move your cursor over these icons and there will be a pop-up tooltip telling you what this icon is about. Famarlize yourself with the available drop-down menus and the icons in the toolbar. \n",

    "### Cells\n",
    "-    The mainbody of the notebook contains a series of \"cells\". In Jupyter Notebook, a cell is a discrete unit of content that can contain either code or text. It's the fundamental building block of a notebook, allowing you to create interactive and executable documents. \n",
    "-    There are two types of cells\n",
    "    *      Code Cells: These cells are used for writing and executing code. You can write Python code directly in these cells. When you run a code cell, the code within it is executed, and the output is displayed below the cell. Code cells enable you to interactively work with and experiment with code.\n",
    "    *      Markdown Cells: These cells use Markdown syntax to format and display text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create nicely formatted text with headings, lists, links, images, and more. Markdown cells are great for providing explanations, documenting your work, and making your notebook more reader-friendly. Try to double click this text and see what happens. Yes, you should now see the source code put in the markdown cell. Click the Run button in the tool bar or type Ctrl+Enter to execute this markdown to see the executed output of this markdown cell.\n"
