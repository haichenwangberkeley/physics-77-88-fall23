    "# Problem 3 Taylor Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "A Taylor expansion, also known as a Taylor series or Taylor polynomial, is a mathematical representation that allows us to approximate a function using a polynomial expression. This approximation is centered around a specific point, often denoted as $x = a$, and it's particularly useful when dealing with functions that might be complex or difficult to work with directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Taylor expansion expresses a function $f(x)$ as an infinite sum of terms involving the function's derivatives evaluated at the point $x = a$. The general formula for the Taylor expansion of a function $f(x)$ centered at $x = a$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \\frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \\cdots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more compact form, using sigma notation, the Taylor series can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f^{(n)}(a)$ represents the $n$th derivative of the function $f(x)$ evaluated at $x = a$.\n",
    "- $n!$ is the factorial of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Taylor expansion becomes more accurate as more terms are included, making it a powerful tool for approximating functions, especially when the function itself is not easy to work with directly. By using only a few terms, it's often possible to get a good approximation of the function's behavior near the point $x = a$.\n"
