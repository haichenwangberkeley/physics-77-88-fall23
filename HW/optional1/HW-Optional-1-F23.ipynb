    "# the Breit-Wigner function\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, the Breit-Wigner function is used to model resonant states. A resonance in this context refers to an unstable particle or state that has a relatively short lifetime before decaying into other particles. The peak of the Breit-Wigner distribution corresponds to the most probable energy of the resonant particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(E) = \\frac{K}{(E - E_0)^2 + (\\Gamma/2)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what each component represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ f(E) $ is the value of the function at the energy $ E $.\n",
    "- $ E_0 $ is the resonant (or peak) energy.\n",
    "- $ \\Gamma $ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the distribution.\n",
    "- $ K $ is a constant that scales the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a python function that implements the Breit-Wigner function. The input arguments are $E$, $E_0$, and $\\Gamma$. $K$ is set to be constant 1. If your function is defined correctly, the value of $f(E = 125, E_0 = 125, \\Gamma = 0.004) $ shoudl be 250000.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plot the Breit-Wigner function between E = 0 and E = 1000, with $E_0$ = 125 and $\\Gamma$=0.004. You may want to see the shape of the function in the logarithmic scale\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the `quad` method from `scipy.integrate` to calculate the integral of the Breit-Wigner function from E = 0 to E = 1000 with $E_0$ = 125 and $\\Gamma$=0.004\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use a Monte Carlo method to perform the same integral, and compare your result with the result from part 3. Make sure they agree within 1% level. Explain in a markdown cell how you achieved this.\n",
