    "The Linear Congruent Generator (LCG) is a pseudorandom number generator that produces a sequence of numbers using a linear recurrence relation. It generates a series of values (random-like) that appear to be random but are entirely determined by its initial parameters.\n",

    "- $X_{n+1}$ is the next value to be generated.\n",

    "# Problem 2: von Neumann Accept-Reject method\n",
    "In this home work problem, you will implement the von Neumann Accept-Reject method in a simple case. In problem 1, you have created a LCG random number generator, which can be used to generate a set of random numbers following a Uniform distribution between 0 and 1. In this problem, we will use the Accept-Reject method to create a set of random numbers that follow a non-uniform PDF. The LCG created in problem 1 will be used here too. Here is the description of this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)$ is the target PDF, meaning that we want to generate a set of random numbers that follow f(x). In this problem, $f(x)$ is defined in $0 \\ge x \\ge 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = x \\cdot sin(\\pi\\cdot x)$\n",
    "Strictly, there should have been a normalization factor in $f(x)$ definition so that the integral of $f(x)$ over (0,1) is 1. Recall one of the foundational axioms of probability is that the probability of the entire sample space (S) is equal to 1. However, for the purpose of generating a random distribution, we do not need to worry about this normalization factor.\n",

    "- first, we generate a uniform random (using the function from your problem 1) between 0 and 1, $x_r$. $x_r$ is a candidate random number that might be kept.\n",
    "- second, we need to decide if we were to keep this random number. For this purpose, we generate another random number between 0 and 1 using the LCG from problem 1. This is referred to as $h_r$. The $x_r$ will be kept if $C \\cdot h_r < f(x_r)$. Otherwise, $x_r$ is discarded.\n",
    "* Here the constant C is a number that is greater than the maximum of f(x) in the interval of (0,1). For example, you may choose C = 1.05 times the maximum of f(x) between 0 and 1\n",

    "Repeat this process for 10000 times, and check if your generated random number set follows the distribution of f(x). Draw the distribution of the random numbers as a histogram with 50 bins between 0 and 1 in $x$."

    "\n",
    "If you used ply.plot to draw the function $f(x)$ and overlay it with the histogram of the generated random numbers, they probably will have different ``scales``, meaning that their heights can be very different. This is because the two objects, the function drawn with plt.plot and the histogram drawn with plt.hist have different normalizations. The scale of the function depends on the value of $f(x)$, while the scale of the histogram depends on the number of entries in the data set. \n",
    "\n",

    "- Histogram object:\n",
    "    * when a histogram is drawn with `plt.hist(A, bins = 50, range=(0,1))`. The AUC is the total number of entries in this histogram, i.e., it's the size of `A`. We can assign a weight to each entry so that the AUC is adjusted. \n",
    "    * for plt.hist(), you can specify the weight of each entry via the weights option. (See https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html for more)\n",

    "    where `wt` is a numpy array of the same shape as `A`. All entries of wt should have a constant value that is `1/A.size`. This ensures that the AUC becomes 1 for this histogram.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Plot object:\n",
    "    * assume the function is displayed as `plt.plot(x,y)` where x is a series of points between 0 and 1, and y are the corresponding values of $f(x)$. The AUC without normalization is `y.sum()` (here x and y are both numpy arrays). \n",
    "    * to make sure the AUC becomes 1, simply do y = y/y.sum(), and then draw the plot with `plt.plot(x,y)`\n",

    "If you follow these instructions correctly, you should see that your function $f(x)$ and the random number distribution have the same scale. If the Part 2.1 was implemented correctly, then they should have the same shape, except that your random number distribution has some fluctuation.  \n"
