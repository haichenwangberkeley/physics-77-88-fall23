    "Newton's Law of Gravity, also known as the Universal Law of Gravitation, states that every point mass attracts every other point mass in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. The formula for this gravitational force ($ F $) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = - G \\frac{M m}{r^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ F $ is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two masses,\n",
    "- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{kg}^2 $,\n",
    "- $ M $ and $ m $ are the masses of the two objects,\n",
    "- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n",
    "- The negative sign `-` indicates that the force is attractive\n",
    "This law not only explains the force between objects like planets and stars but also provides the basis for understanding orbits and the motion of celestial bodies in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we simplified the math by assuming the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M$ = 1000\n",
    "- $m$ = 1\n",
    "- $G$ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "At $t$ = 0, the positions of object $M$ and $m$ in $(x,y)$ are (0,0) and (100,0). Their velocities are (0,0), and (0,$v_0$), where the two components are corresponding to the velocity projection in $x$ and $y$ directions. One can assume that the object $M$ stays static because its mass is so much larger than that of object $m$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the following ODEs that determine the orbit of the object $m$:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dx}{dt}(t) = F_x dt + \\frac{dx}{dt}(t-dt)$$\n",

    "**Motion in the $y$ direction**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy}{dt}(t) = F_y dt + \\frac{dy}{dt}(t-dt)$$\n",
    "$$ y(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt}\\cdot dt + y(t-dt)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here we decompose the motion of $m$ into its motion in the $x$ and $y$ directions and treat them separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The gravitational force can be decomposed into its x and y projections:**\n",
    "$$ F = - \\frac{1000}{r^2}$$\n",

    "$$F_x = F\\cdot \\frac{(x_m - x_M)}{r}$$\n",

    "$$F_y = F\\cdot \\frac{(y_m - y_M)}{r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r = \\sqrt{(x_m - x_M)^2 + (y_m - y_M)^2}$$\n",
