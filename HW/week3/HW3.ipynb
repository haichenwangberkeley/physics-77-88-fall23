    "# Problem 1: Prime Number\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. For example, under 10, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers; while 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part-1 Write a function to determine if a natural number is an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "1. This function (`is_prime`)  takes two input arguments, N and verbose. N is the natural number to test, and verbose is a Boolean variable to control if any printout is made while executing the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The returning variable is Boolean. It indicates if the number under test is a prime number of not. True means it is a prime number, while False means it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When the input argument verbose is True. The function should print out the following message(s): \n",
    "    - If the nubmer is not a prime one, then you must have found at least one way to factorize the number. As such, you can include this line in your code:\n",
    "                   ` print(f\"{N} is not prime as it can be expressed as {M} * {K}.\")`\n",
    "    This line allows you to properly display the values of integers N, M, and K. For example, `451 is not prime as it can be expressed as 41 * 11.`\n",
    "    - If the number is a prime number, then your function should print something like 3 is a prime number by including a line like  `print(f'{N} is a prime number')`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This function should not use any modules such as math, numpy, etc.. Simply go over all possible natural numbers smaller than the number to test, e.g., for 5, just check if 5%M == 0, where M could be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This requires you implement a loop structure in the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use your function to check if the following numbers are prime:\n",
    "    - 3431, 3533, 3534319, 3534313\n",
    "    - you should turn verbose to True for these tests\n",

    "Here, we use the function defined in Part-1 to check the frequency of prime numbers. Specifically, we want to know how many prime numbers are there for every interval of 100, e.g., 1 - 100, 101 - 200, .... 2901 - 3000\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a new function (`prime_counter`) that would return the total number of prime numbers within an interval that is specified by start and end, where start and end are the input arguments of this function. `start` and `end` are included in the interval, e.g., for the interval 101 - 200, the `start` is 101, and the `end` is 200, and you would check all the numbers between 101 and 200, as well as 101 and 200. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. This function should call the function defined in Part-1. In other words, you need exploit the function that you developed and you don't want to reinvent the wheel. Hints - create a loop to go over all the intergers between `start` and `end`, call the `is_prime` function for each integer, count how many times `is_prime` returns True. To avoid lengthy printout, when you can `is_prime`, turn the verbose option to False. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a list `prime_counts` to store the prime number counts for these intervals. Between 1 and 3000, we have 30 intervals of 100. Your list will then have 30 entries, each of which is the number of prime numbers in the corresponding interval. Print out the list. \n",

As we discussed during the lecture, the data structure `set` only has unique entries. So one way to do it is to force convert the list `prime_counts` to a set, and then convert the set back to a list. You can try these lines\n",
