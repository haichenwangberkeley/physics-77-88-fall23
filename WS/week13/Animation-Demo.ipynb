    "#### Explaining FuncAnimation Parameters in Python's Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    " Below is a breakdown of each parameter in the context of the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "anim = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, init_func=init, frames=200, interval=20, blit=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`fig`**: This represents the figure object where your animation will be drawn. In `matplotlib`, a figure can be thought of as a canvas on which graphs, data points, and other plot elements are drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`animate`**: This function is called for each frame of the animation. It should update the elements of the plot that are meant to change. In the given example, it's responsible for moving the sine wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`init_func=init`**: The `init_func` sets up the initial state of the plot and is called at the beginning of the animation. This function is optional but useful for initializing your plot elements. If it's not provided, `FuncAnimation` will call `animate` with a zero argument and use that result as the initial frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`frames=200`**: This parameter defines the total number of frames in the animation. Each frame results in a call to the `animate` function. For example, setting `frames=200` means `animate` is called 200 times throughout the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`interval=20`**: This sets the delay between frames in milliseconds. An `interval=20` means there is a 20ms delay between each frame. Adjusting this value alters the speed of the animation; a smaller interval speeds it up, while a larger one slows it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`blit=True`**: Blitting is an optimization method in animation. When set to `True`, only parts of the plot that have changed are redrawn for each frame, enhancing the efficiency and smoothness of the animation. This is especially beneficial for complex or large animations. However, it requires both the `animate` and `init_func` to return an iterable of all the modified or newly created artists. Note that blitting may not be supported in all environments, particularly in some Jupyter Notebook backends.\n"

    "This script generates and animates a 2D random walk using Python's `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports and Function Definition:\n",
    "- **Imports**: The script begins by importing necessary modules: `numpy` for numerical operations and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting. Additionally, `FuncAnimation` is imported from `matplotlib.animation` for creating the animation.\n",
    "- **Function `random_walk_2d`**: This function is defined to generate a two-dimensional random walk. It takes `n_steps` as an argument to specify the number of steps in the walk. The function generates random step sizes (`dx`, `dy`) and directions, and computes the cumulative sum to get the x and y coordinates of the walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up the Plot:\n",
    "- The script sets `n_steps` to 100 and calls `random_walk_2d` to obtain the x and y coordinates.\n",
    "- A figure and axes (`fig, ax`) are created using `matplotlib`, and a line plot (`line`) and a point marker (`point`) are initialized. The plot is styled with gridlines, a legend, equal aspect ratio, and labeled axes. The axes' limits are set based on the `x` and `y` values, with some padding for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Animation Function:\n",
    "- The `animate` function is defined to update the data of the `line` and `point` objects for each frame. It plots the path of the walk up to the current step and highlights the current position with a red point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Animation:\n",
    "- The animation is created using `FuncAnimation`, which takes the figure (`fig`), the `animate` function, the number of frames equal to `n_steps`, and sets `blit=True` for efficient rendering. The `repeat` parameter is set to `False` to prevent the animation from looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying and Saving the Animation:\n",
    "- The layout is adjusted using `plt.tight_layout()` for a neater display, and the animation is shown using `plt.show()`.\n",
    "- Finally, the animation is saved as a GIF file named 'random_walk.gif', using the `Pillow` writer at 60 frames per second.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "   from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation, PillowWriter\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `numpy` is used for numerical operations.\n",
    "   - `matplotlib.pyplot` and `FuncAnimation` from `matplotlib.animation` are used for plotting and animating, respectively.\n",
    "   - `PillowWriter` is imported for saving the animation as a GIF.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameters and Pegs Setup**:\n",
    "   - The number of rows (`num_rows`) and initial position of pegs are defined.\n",
    "   - The script calculates the number of pegs in each row and defines their radius and spacing.\n",
    "   - A `for` loop is used to create a grid of pegs on a `matplotlib` axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Figure and Axis Configuration**:\n",
    "   - The figure and axis are set up with two subplots: one for the Galton Board and another for the histogram showing the distribution of final positions of the balls.\n",
    "   - The axis limits and aspect ratio are set for better visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Animation Setup**:\n",
    "   - A line object (`line`) is initialized for updating the path of each ball.\n",
    "   - The `init` function is defined to initialize the animation.\n",
    "   - The `update` function calculates the path of each ball, simulates its motion, and updates the histogram with the final position of each ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating and Saving the Animation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num_balls = 200  # Number of balls to simulate\n",
    "   ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=num_balls, init_func=init, blit=True, repeat=False)\n",

    "   ani.save(\"galton_board.gif\", writer=writer, dpi=72)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `FuncAnimation` creates the animation with a specified number of balls.\n",
    "   - The animation is saved as a GIF file using `PillowWriter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "This script demonstrates a Galton Board simulation where balls drop through a series of pegs, each deflecting randomly to the left or right, resulting in a normal distribution-like pattern at the bottom. The animation captures both the motion of the balls and the evolving distribution of their final positions.\n"
