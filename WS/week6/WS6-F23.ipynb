    "SciPy (pronounced \"sigh-pie\") is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It is built on top of the NumPy library and provides a host of functionalities that extend beyond NumPy's capabilities. The name \"SciPy\" also refers specifically to the central library within this ecosystem, which is used for high-level computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scipy.stats** module is a significant part of the SciPy library, dedicated to statistical functions and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diverse Distributions: The module provides tools to work with a wide range of probability distributions, both continuous and discrete. This includes standard distributions like normal, uniform, binomial, poisson, and many more specialized ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Functions: Functions for computing statistics are available, such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. It also provides functions for more advanced statistical tests, like t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests, and correlation coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Sampling and Data Generation: Tools to generate random samples from various distributions, which can be particularly useful for simulations or generating synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Utilities: Functions for tasks like histogram creation, data transformation, and kernel density estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will use functions available in scipy.stats module to understand the qualititve behavior of the most common PDFs/PMFs**"
